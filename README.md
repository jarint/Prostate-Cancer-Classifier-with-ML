# Prostate-Cancer-Classifier-with-ML
A set of prostate cancer image classifiers using multiple machine learning approaches. 

This project was done as part of a bioinformatics course I took back in 2020. It was my first attempt at doing anything in ML (and frankly, it wasn't very good - I had barely just started coding at this point).

The results from my analysis are in my final report, which is also included in this repo.
